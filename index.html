    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>My name is Kevin Perez, I was born in 1998 in Guatemala, and moved to the United states in 2012.
        My love for art began in elementary school, first with doodling, which quickly transitioned to
        drawing and painting after taking my first art class freshman year of high school. I have been 
        creating art with various materials and methods ever since then, about 6 years.</p>

    <p> I had the opportunity to study art during my years in high school, where I learned how to create art 
        through various techniques and methods. I learned how to paint using acrylic on canvas, water-color, ink,
        pencil, spray paint, and towards the end of my high school years I was able to learn ceramics and graphic arts. 
        I love adding vibrant and whimsical colors to my art pieces which is why I would call my style a mix between 
        realism and surrealism. </p>
