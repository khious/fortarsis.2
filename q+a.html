    <h2> Q &amp; A </h2>
    
    <dl> 
		<dt>Do you have any art careers? </dt>
        <dd> No, I am mostly self taught even though I took a few art classes during my high school years.</dd>
			
        <dt>How much are your commissions? </dt>
        <dd> There isn't a set price, it would be difficult to come up with a price model since most commissions vary by canvas size, materials, and other factors such as shipping.</dd>
        
        <dt>Do you retain rights fo each commission? </dt>
        <dd> Yes, for each work of art, I reserve production rights, as well as the right to exhibit the work. Everything is in the contract upon signing and finalizing. </dd>
        
        <dt> Who are your biggest incluencers?</dt>
        <dd> As far as surrealism painting, definetly Salvador Dali, a skilled artist best known for the bizzare iamges in his work. </dd>
        
        <dt> What inspires you to paint?</dt>
        <dd> I am inspired by a lot of things, like the process of painting itself is very relaxing. Creating something new and different using canvas, pigments, and my own imagination.  </dd>
        
        <dd> Additionally, the idea of communication ideas and feelings to other people through my work and seeing my art work resoante with you, the viewer and art enthusiats. </dd>
        
        <dt>Did you always want to be an artist? </dt>
        <dd>Yes, ever since I was a kid i always loved portraying my emotions and feelings through my creations.  </dd>
        
        <dt> What advice would you give your younger self?</dt>
        <dd> I would tell myself to never stop creating art, work smart, hard and add a dose of self promotion. 
        At one point I completly stopped drawing, and paiting for almost three years. I worked hard and smart but totally oblivious to the self-promotion part. Which resulted in people not knowing my art even existed. </dd>
